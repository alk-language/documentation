Alk is an algorithmic language intended to be used for teaching data structures and algorithms
using an abstraction notation (independent of programming language).
The goal is to have a language that:
is simple to be easily understood;
* is expressive enough to describe a large class of algorithms from various problem domains;
* is abstract: the algorithm description must make abstraction of implementation details,
e.g., the low-level representation of data;
* is a good mean for learning how to algorithmically think;
* supply a rigorous computation model suitable to analyse algorithms;
* is executable: the algorithm can be executed, even if they are partially designed;
* is accompanied by a set of tools helping to analyse the algorithm correctness and the
eficiency;
* input and output are given as abstract data types, ignoring implementation details.

There are two implementations of the Alk language:
- k-semantics (deprecated) - requires K3.6
- java-semantics (in progress)

Each implmentation has its own repository, including the specific documentation. There are some differences between the two implemantations of the language.
